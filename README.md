## AI Features with Portal (Powered by Ollama)

Galdr's Portal AI Assistant leverages local Large Language Models to provide contextual help while keeping your data 100% private. To enable this feature, you must have Ollama installed and running.

**1. Install Ollama:**
   - Visit [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/) and download the application for your operating system.

**2. Download an AI Model:**
   - After installing, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to download the recommended Llama 3 model:
     ```bash
     ollama pull llama3
     ```

**3. Run Galdr:**
   - Start Galdr. The Portal will automatically connect to your local Ollama service. You can configure the model and endpoint in Galdr's settings.
